title: Invited Talk Track 2 - AI in Healthcare: Working Towards Positive Clinical Impact
abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare hold great promise, aiming to empower clinicians to diagnose and treat medical conditions earlier and more effectively. To ensure that AI solutions deliver on this promise, it is important to approach the design of prototype solutions with clinical applicability in mind, envisioning how they might fit within existing clinical workflows. Here we provide a brief overview of how we are incorporating this thinking  in our research projects, while highlighting challenges that lie ahead.
