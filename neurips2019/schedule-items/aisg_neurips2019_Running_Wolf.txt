title: Invited Talk Track 3 - Sacred Waveforms: An Indigenous Perspective on the Ethics of Collecting and Usage of Spiritual Data for Machine Learning
abstract: This talk is an introduction to the intersection of revitalizing sacred knowledge and exploitation of this data. For centuries Indigenous Peoples of the Americas have resisted the loss of their land, technology, and cultural knowledge. This resistance has been enabled by vibrant cultural protocols, unique to each tribal nation, which controls the sharing of, and limits access to sacred knowledge. Technology has made preserving cultural data easy, but there is a natural tension between reigniting ancient knowledge and mediums that allow uncontrollable exploitation of this data. Easy to access ML opens a new path toward creating new Indigenous technology, such as ASR, but creating AI using Indigenous heritage requires care.
