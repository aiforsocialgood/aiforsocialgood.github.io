title: Panel Discussion Track 3 - Towards a Social Good? Theories of Change in AI
abstract: Considerable hope and energy is put into AI -- and its critique -- under the assumption that the field will make the world a “better” place by maximizing social good. Will it? For who? At what time scale? Most importantly, who defines "social good"? <br /> This panel invites dissent. Leading voices will pick apart these questions by sharing their own competing theories of social change in relation to AI. In addition to answering audience questions, they will share how they decide on trade-offs between pragmatism and principles and how they resist elements of AI research that are known to be dangerous and/or socially degenerative, particularly in relation to surveillance, criminal justice and privacy. <br /> We undertake a probing and genuine conversation around these questions. Audience members are invited to submit questions <a href="https://app.sli.do/event/yndumbf3/live/questions">here</a>.
