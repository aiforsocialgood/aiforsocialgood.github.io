title: Panel Discussion Track 1 - AI and Sustainable Development
abstract: The focus on this panel is the use of AI for Sustainable Development and will explore the many opportunities this technology presents to improve lives around the world, as well as address the challenges and barriers to its applications. While there is much outstanding work being done to apply AI to such situations, too often this research is not deployed and there is a disconnect between the research and industry communities and the public sector actors. With leading researchers and practitioners from across the academic, public, UN and private sectors this panel brings a diversity of experience to address these important issues.
