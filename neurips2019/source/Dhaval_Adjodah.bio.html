<span class="label label-warning">Facilitator</span> Dhaval Adjodah is a research scientist at the MIT Media Lab. His research investigates the current limitations of generalization in machine learning as well as how to move beyond them by leveraging the social cognitive adaptations humans evolved to collaborate effectively at scale. Beyond pushing the limits of modern machine learning, he is also interested in improving institutions by using online human experiments to better understand the cognitive limits and biases that affect everyday individual economic, political, and social decisions. During his PhD, Dhaval was an intern in Prof. Yoshua Bengio's group at MILA, a member of the Harvard Berkman Assembly on Ethics and Governance in ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence, and a fellow at the Dalai Lama Center For Ethics And Transformative Values. He has a B.S. in Physics from MIT, and an M.S. in Technology Policy from the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society.
