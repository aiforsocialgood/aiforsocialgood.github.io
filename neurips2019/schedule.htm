    <h4>8:05AM-8:25AM  Invited Talk Track 1 - Computational Sustainability: Computing for a Better World and a Sustainable Future</h4>

   <p>
         Computational sustainability is a new interdisciplinary research field with the overarching goal of developing computational models, methods, and tools to help manage the balance of environmental, economic, and societal needs for a sustainable future. I will provide a short overview of computational sustainability, with examples ranging from wildlife conservation and biodiversity to evaluating the impacts of hydropower dam proliferation in the Amazon basin. Our research leverages the recent artificial intelligence (AI) advances in deep learning, reasoning, and decision making. I will highlight cross-cutting computational themes, how AI enriches sustainability sciences and conversely, how sustainability questions enrich AI and computer science.

    <h4>8:25AM-8:45AM  Invited Talk Track 1 - Translating AI Research into operational impact to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals</h4>

   <p>
         In September 2015, Member States of the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals: a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new global agenda. To achieve the SDGs by 2030, governments, private sector, civil society and academia must work together. In this talk, I will present my journey working almost a decade at UN Global Pulse - an innovation initiative of the UN Secretary General- researching and developing real applications of data innovation and AI for sustainable development, humanitarian action and peace. The work of the UN includes providing food and assistance to 80 million people, supplying vaccines to 45% of the world's children and assisting 65 million people fleeing war, famine and persecution.  Examples of innovation projects include understanding perceptions on refugees from social data; mapping population movements in the aftermath of natural disasters; understanding recovery from shocks with financial transaction data; using satellite data to inform humanitarian operations in conflict zones or monitoring public radio to give voice to citizens in unconnected areas. Based on these examples, the session will discuss operational realities and the global policy environment, as well as challenges and opportunities for the research community to ensure that its groundbreaking discoveries are used responsibly and can be translated into social impact for all.

    <h4>8:45AM-9:15AM  Invited Talk Track 3 - Sacred Waveforms: An Indigenous Perspective on the Ethics of Collecting and Usage of Spiritual Data for Machine Learning</h4>

   <p>
         This talk is an introduction to the intersection of revitalizing sacred knowledge and exploitation of this data. For centuries Indigenous Peoples of the Americas have resisted the loss of their land, technology, and cultural knowledge. This resistance has been enabled by vibrant cultural protocols, unique to each tribal nation, which controls the sharing of, and limits access to sacred knowledge. Technology has made preserving cultural data easy, but there is a natural tension between reigniting ancient knowledge and mediums that allow uncontrollable exploitation of this data. Easy to access ML opens a new path toward creating new Indigenous technology, such as ASR, but creating AI using Indigenous heritage requires care.

    <h4>9:15AM-9:20AM  Contributed Talk Track 1 - Balancing Competing Objectives for Welfare-Aware Machine Learning with Imperfect Data</h4>

   <p>
         From financial loans and humanitarian aid, to medical diagnosis and criminal justice, consequential decisions in society increasingly rely on machine learning. In most cases, the machine learning algorithms used in these contexts are trained to optimize a single metric of performance; however, most real-world decisions exist in a multi-objective setting that requires the balance of multiple incentives and outcomes. To this end, we develop a methodology for optimizing multi-objective decisions. Building on the traditional notion of Pareto optimality, we focus on understanding how to balance multiple objectives when those objectives are measured noisily or not directly observed. We believe this regime of imperfect information is far more common in real-world decisions, where one cannot easily measure the social consequences of an algorithmic decision. To show how the multi-objective framework can be used in practice, we present results using data from roughly 40,000 videos promoted by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. This illustrates the empirical trade-off between maximizing user engagement and promoting high-quality videos. We show that multi-objective optimization could produce substantial increases in average video quality at the expense of almost negligible reductions in user engagement.

   <p>
         While artificial intelligence (AI) and other automation technologies might lead to enormous progress in healthcare, they may also have undesired consequences for people working in the field. In this interdisciplinary study, we capture empirical evidence of not only what healthcare work could be automated, but also what should be automated. We quantitatively investigate these research questions by utilizing probabilistic machine learning models trained on thousands of ratings, provided by both healthcare practitioners and automation experts. Based on our findings, we present an analytical tool (Automatability-Desirability Matrix) to support policymakers and organizational leaders in developing practical strategies on how to harness the positive power of automation technologies, while accompanying change and empowering stakeholders in a participatory fashion.

   <p>
         Considerable hope and energy is put into AI -- and its critique -- under the assumption that the field will make the world a “better” place by maximizing social good. Will it? For who? At what time scale? Most importantly, who defines "social good"? <br /> This panel invites dissent. Leading voices will pick apart these questions by sharing their own competing theories of social change in relation to AI. In addition to answering audience questions, they will share how they decide on trade-offs between pragmatism and principles and how they resist elements of AI research that are known to be dangerous and/or socially degenerative, particularly in relation to surveillance, criminal justice and privacy. <br /> We undertake a probing and genuine conversation around these questions.

    <h4>11:30AM-11:35AM  Contributed Talk Track 2 - Hard Choices in AI Safety</h4>

   <p>
         As AI systems become prevalent in high stakes domains such as surveillance and healthcare, researchers now examine how to design and implement them in a safe manner. However, the potential harms caused by systems to stakeholders in complex social contexts and how to address these remains unclear. In this paper, we explain the inherent normative uncertainty in debates about the safety of AI systems. We then address this as a problem of vagueness by examining its place in the design, training, and deployment stages of AI system development. We adopt Ruth Chang's theory of intuitive comparability to illustrate the dilemmas that manifest at each stage. We then discuss how stakeholders can navigate these dilemmas by incorporating distinct forms of dissent into the development pipeline, drawing on Elizabeth Anderson's work on the epistemic powers of democratic institutions. We outline a framework of sociotechnical commitments to formal, substantive and discursive challenges that address normative uncertainty across stakeholders, and propose the cultivation of related virtues by those responsible for development.

    <h4>11:35AM-11:40AM  Contributed Talk Track 3 - The Effects of Competition and Regulation on Error Inequality in Data-driven Markets</h4>

   <p>
         Much work has documented instances of unfairness in deployed machine learning models, and significant effort has been dedicated to creating algorithms that take into account issues of fairness. Our work highlight an important but understudied source of unfairness: market forces that drive differing amounts of firm investment in data across populations.We develop a high-level framework, based on insights from learning theory and industrial organization, to study this phenomenon. In a simple model of this type of data-driven market, we first show that a monopoly will invest unequally in the groups. There are two natural avenues for preventing this disparate impact: promoting competition and regulating firm behavior. We show first that competition, under many natural models, does not eliminate incentives to invest unequally, and can even exacerbate it. We then consider two avenues for regulating the monopoly - requiring the monopoly to ensure that each group’s error rates are low, or forcing each group’s error rates to be similar to each other - and quantify the price of fairness (and who pays it). These models imply that mitigating fairness concerns may require policy-driven solutions, and not only technological ones.

   <p>
         One thing that differentiates policy-driven machine learning is that new public policies are often implemented in a trial-and-error fashion, as data might not be available upfront. In this work, we try to accomplish approximate group fairness in an online decision-making process where examples are sampled \textit{i.i.d} from an underlying distribution. Our work follows from the classical learning-from-experts scheme, extending the multiplicative weights algorithm by keeping separate weights for label classes as well as groups. Although accuracy and fairness are often conflicting goals, we try to mitigate the trade-offs using an optimization step and demonstrate the performance on real data set.

   <p>
         Much of the discourse on AI ethics has focused on technical improvements and holding individuals accountable to prevent accidents and malicious use of AI. While this is useful and necessary, such an “agency-focused” approach does not cover all the harmful outcomes caused by AI. In particular it ignores the more indirect and complex risks resulting from AI’s interaction with the socio-economic and political context. A “structural” approach is needed to account for such broader negative impacts where no individual can be held accountable. This is particularly relevant for AI applied to systemic issues such as climate change. This talk explains why a structural approach is needed in addition to the existing agency approach to AI ethics, and offers some preliminary suggestions for putting this into practice.

        My research interests lie at the intersection of theory and impactful real-world AI applications, with a particular focus on AI in healthcare, which I have been pursuing at DeepMind since early 2016. In our most recent work, published in Nature in July 2019, we demonstrate how deep learning can be used for accurate early predictions of patient deterioration from electronic health records and alerting that opens possibilities for timely interventions and preventative care. Prior to moving to London, I had been involved with other applied projects at Google, such as Email Intelligence and the Chrome Data team. I obtained my PhD in 2013 from the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at JSI in Slovenia, where I was working on better understanding the consequences of the curse of dimensionality in instance-based learning in many dimensions.

    <h4>4:15PM-4:20PM  Contributed Talk Track 3 - "Good" isn't good enough</h4>

   <p>
         Despite widespread enthusiasm among computer scientists to contribute to “social good,” the field's efforts to promote good lack a rigorous foundation in politics or social change. There is limited discourse regarding what “good” actually entails, and instead a reliance on vague notions of what aspects of society are good or bad. Moreover, the field rarely considers the types of social change that result from algorithmic interventions, instead following a “greedy algorithm” approach of pursuing technology-centric incremental reform at all points. In order to reason well about doing good, computer scientists must adopt language and practices to reason reflexively about political commitments, a praxis that considers the long-term impacts of technological interventions, and an interdisciplinary focus that no longer prioritizes technical considerations as superior to other forms of knowledge.

    <h4>4:20PM-4:50PM  Invited Talk Track 1 - Automated Quality Control for a Weather Sensor Network</h4>

   <p>
         TAHMO (the Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory) is a growing network of more than 500 automated weather stations. The eventual goal is to operate 20,000 stations covering all of sub-Saharan Africa and providing ground truth for weather and climate models. Because sensors fail and go out of calibration, some form of quality control is needed to detect bad values and determine when a technician needs to visit a station. We are deploying a three-layer architecture that consists of (a) fitted anomaly detection models, (b) probabilistic diagnosis of broken sensors, and (c) spatial statistics to detect extreme weather events (that may exonerate flagged sensors).

         The focus on this panel is the use of AI for Sustainable Development and will explore the many opportunities this technology presents to improve lives around the world, as well as address the challenges and barriers to its applications. While there is much outstanding work being done to apply AI to such situations, too often this research is not deployed and there is a disconnect between the research and industry communities and the public sector actors. With leading researchers and practitioners from across the academic, public, UN and private sectors this panel brings a diversity of experience to address these important issues. <br /> Audience members are invited to submit questions <a href="https://app.sli.do/event/skexhgej/live/questions">here</a>.
