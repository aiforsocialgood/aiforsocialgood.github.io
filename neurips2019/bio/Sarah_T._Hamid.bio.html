Sarah T. Hamid is an abolitionist and organizer in Southern California, working to build community defense against carceral technologies. She's built and worked on campaigns against predictive policing, risk assessment technologies, public/private surveillance partnerships, electronic monitoring, and automated border screening.

In March 2019, she co-founded the Prison Tech Research Group (PTR-Grp), a coalition of abolitionists working on the intersection of technology/innovation and the prison-industrial complex. PTR-Grp focuses on private-public research partnerships deployed under the guise of prison reform, which stage the prison as a site for technological innovation and low-cost testing. The project centers the needs and safety of incarcerated and directly impacted people who face the violently expropriative data science industry with few safety nets.

Sarah also facilitates the monthly convening of the Community Defense Syllabus, during which activists of color from all over the country work to theorize the intersection of race and carceral computing. In 2020, she will lead the launch and roll-out of the Carceral Tech Resistance Network, a community archive and knowledge-sharing project that seeks to amplify the capacity of community organizations to resist the encroachment and experimentation of harmful technologies.
