Michael Running Wolf was raised in a rural village in Montana with intermittent water and electricity; naturally he now has a Masters of Science in Computer Science. Though he is a published poet, he is a computer nerd at heart. His lifelong goal is to pursue endangered indigenous language revitalization using Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) technology. He was raised with a grandmother who only spoke his tribal language, Cheyenne, which like many other indigenous languages is near extinction. By leveraging his advanced Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and his technical skills, Michael hopes to strengthen the ecology of thought represented by indigenous languages through immersive technology.
